# NovaAI

NovaAI is an extensible AI workstation framework that provides tools, utilities, and opinionated defaults for building, running, and integrating AI models and agents. It aims to help researchers and engineers prototype model-driven systems quickly while keeping production-readiness in mind.

## Features

- Modular plugin architecture for models, data connectors, and interfaces
- Utilities for dataset preprocessing and evaluation
- CLI for common tasks (train, evaluate, serve)
- Lightweight agent orchestration helpers
- Opinionated defaults for reproducible experiments

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repo:

   git clone <repo-url> novai
   cd novai

2. Install dependencies (adjust for your environment):

   - Python: use a virtualenv or `conda` environment
   - Node (optional): for frontend/dashboard

3. Run the main app or demo:

   - Python demo: `python -m novaai.demo`
   - Start server: `python -m novaai.server` (if available)

Replace the commands above with the actual entry points in the repository.

## Installation

Python (recommended)

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate

2. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Node (optional)

1. Install Node.js (v16+ recommended)
2. Install dependencies:

   cd web
   npm install

## Usage

- Run training: `python -m novaai.train --config configs/train.yaml`
- Evaluate a model: `python -m novaai.evaluate --model runs/latest`
- Serve a model: `python -m novaai.serve --model runs/latest --port 8080`

Check the repository for the actual CLI entrypoints and update these commands accordingly.

## Configuration

Configuration is typically provided via YAML files under `configs/` and environment variables. Example keys:

- MODEL_NAME: name of the model class
- DATA_PATH: path to training data
- CHECKPOINT_DIR: where to save model checkpoints

## Development

- Run linters: `flake8` or `pylint` depending on your preferred tools
- Run unit tests: `pytest`
- Format code: `black .`

Add `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and CI workflows (GitHub Actions) as needed.

## Architecture Overview

High level components:

- core/: model interfaces and training loop
- agents/: agent orchestrators and utilities
- data/: dataset loaders and preprocessing
- web/: optional dashboard and REST API
- examples/: runnable toy examples and demos

Adjust these sections to match the actual repository structure.

## Examples

Provide short, copy-pastable examples showing how to train and run the models. Example:

```python
from novaai import Model, Trainer

model = Model.from_config("configs/model.yaml")
trainer = Trainer(model)
trainer.train(data_path="data/train.csv")
```

## Testing

- Run tests: `pytest -q`
- Add unit tests for critical components under `tests/`

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Commit changes and open a PR

Follow the repository's code style and add tests for new features.

## Troubleshooting

- If dependencies fail to install, ensure your Python and pip are up to date
- For GPU builds, verify CUDA and drivers are compatible with your PyTorch/TensorFlow build

## License

Specify the license used by the project (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0). If none, add one to the repo.

## Assumptions & Notes

- This README is a template. Tailor commands, paths, and module names to match your codebase.
- If you'd like, I can scan the repo and update this README to be exact about entrypoints, dependencies, and examples.
